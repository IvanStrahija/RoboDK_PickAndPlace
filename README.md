# RoboDK_PickAndPlace
The program utilizes the RoboDK software and RoboDK Python SDK to create a virtual environment where robot can perform pick and place operations for palletizing objects. The majority of 3D models used in the simulation are custom made, providing a customized and realistic environment for testing and optimizing specific palletization process.
